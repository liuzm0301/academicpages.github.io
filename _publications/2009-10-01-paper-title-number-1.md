A low-power biomedical signal acquisition SoC is proposed for continuous health monitoring system. The SoC fully integrates a low-noise analog front-end (AFE), a current-steering low-pass filter (CSLPF), and an output buffer. A DC-rejection loop and a chopping function are added to enhance the noise performance. For processing various bio-signals, the bandwidth can be adjusted to extract the signals in specific bands. The SoC, designed in a standard 0.13μm CMOS technology, passes signals from 0.3Hz to 154Hz and from 0.5Hz to 117Hz with a simulated input referred noise of 0.4μVrms and achieves maximum gains of 36dB and 42dB respectively. The power consumption is 1μW from a 1V DC supply voltage.
